**Cyber Threat Management Platform: Reconnaissance, Profiling, and AI-Driven Phishing Simulations**

**Introduction**
In the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, proactive measures are crucial for organizations to protect their digital assets. Our Cyber Threat Management Platform offers comprehensive solutions for predicting potential cyber threats, managing campaigns, profiling targets, and conducting sophisticated phishing simulations. This report outlines our platform's key features and benefits, focusing on Reconnaissance and Campaign Management, Profiling and Detailed Analytics, and AI-Driven Phishing Simulations.
1. **Reconnaissance and Campaign Management**
Goal: Our platform aims to streamline the reconnaissance process and provide efficient campaign management through an interactive dashboard. This module is designed to help users gather and manage information about potential threats effectively.
**Features:**
**Interactive Dashboard:** The platform features a user-friendly dashboard with a login feature, allowing users to view all campaigns, analytics, and visualizations of past campaigns. Users can easily navigate and manage their campaigns with a clean and intuitive interface.
Campaign Management: Users can create and view campaigns with the following functionalities:
**New Campaigns:** Select a target domain name and choose from a drop-down list of campaigns sorted by date.
**View Campaigns:** **Access past campaigns by selecting a target domain name from a date-sorted drop-down list.
**Automated Reconnaissance:** Upon entering a target domain name, the platform automatically identifies active email addresses using reconnaissance techniques such as Google Dorking, web crawling, and API integration with tools like Hunter.io. The identified email addresses are then validated and filtered to distinguish between active and inactive addresses.
**Manual CSV Upload:** Users have the option to manually upload a CSV file containing email addresses. The platform cross-references these addresses with automatically gathered data, highlighting new and unique email addresses.
**Deliverables:**
A detailed report on the tools and methods used for reconnaissance.
A comprehensive list of all active email addresses for each campaign.

3. **Profiling and Detailed Analytics**
**Goal:** To provide in-depth profiling of identified email addresses, enabling organizations to understand their targets better and tailor their security strategies accordingly.
**Features:**
Parameter Identification: The platform defines ten key parameters for profiling, including age, gender, country, possible name, job title, social media profiles, interests, recent activities, affiliations, and contact numbers.
**Automated Profiling:** Utilizing advanced tools, the platform automates the profiling process to gather data on the identified parameters. This helps in building a comprehensive profile for each active email address.
**Manual Profiling:** Users can manually input or correct data using an Excel sheet if the automated process misses certain information. This ensures accuracy and completeness in the profiling process.
Visualization: The dashboard visualizes the collected profiling data, providing clear and actionable insights into the targets. Users can analyze historical trends and inform future strategies based on these insights.
**Deliverables:**
A detailed report on the tools and methods used for profiling.
A comprehensive profile for each active email address, complete with visualized data on the dashboard.

**4. AI-Driven Phishing Simulations**
**Goal:** To enhance organizational preparedness against phishing attacks by generating realistic phishing emails and simulating user responses using AI-driven personas.
**Features:**
AI Model Training: The platform collects a dataset of spam emails to train an AI model capable of identifying characteristics of spam emails and generating convincing phishing emails.
Phishing Email Creation: Using the trained model, the platform creates phishing emails that mimic the communication style of users within the target domain. These emails include phishing links or attachments to test the effectiveness of the simulation.
Phishing Campaign Execution: An AI bot sends the generated phishing emails to the identified active email addresses. The platform tracks and documents the success of these campaigns, measuring metrics such as email open rates and click rates on phishing links.
Bot Communication and Validation: The platform develops AI personas that mimic real-life users. These bots respond to phishing emails, simulating human behavior. The platform evaluates the success of phishing attempts based on the bots' responses. If a phishing attempt fails, the platform generates new email content and retries the attempt until successful.
