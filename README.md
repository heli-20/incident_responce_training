**Cyber Threat Management Platform: Reconnaissance, Profiling, and AI-Driven Phishing Simulations**

**Introduction**
Our Cyber Threat Management Platform provides solutions for identifying and managing cyber threats through Reconnaissance, Profiling, and AI-Driven Phishing Simulations. The platform helps organizations enhance their security posture by simulating phishing attacks and profiling potential targets.
1. **Reconnaissance and Campaign Management**
Goal: Our platform aims to streamline the reconnaissance process and provide efficient campaign management through an interactive dashboard. This module is designed to help users gather and manage information about potential threats effectively.
**Features:**
**Interactive Dashboard:** The platform features a user-friendly dashboard with a login feature, allowing users to view all campaigns, and view records of past campaigns. Users can easily navigate and manage their campaigns with a clean and intuitive interface.
Campaign Management: Users can create and view campaigns with the following functionalities:
**New Campaigns:** Select a target domain name and choose from a drop-down list of campaigns sorted by date.
**View Campaigns:** **Access past campaigns by selecting a target domain name from a date-sorted drop-down list.
**Automated Reconnaissance:** Upon entering a target domain name, the platform automatically identifies active email addresses using reconnaissance techniques such as Google Dorking, web crawling, and API integration with tools like Hunter.io. The identified email addresses are then validated and filtered to distinguish between active and inactive addresses.
**Manual CSV Upload:** Users have the option to manually upload a CSV file containing email addresses. The platform cross-references these addresses with automatically gathered data, highlighting new and unique email addresses.

**Deliverables:**
A comprehensive list of all active email addresses for each campaign.

2. **Profiling and Detailed Analytics**
**Goal:** To provide in-depth profiling of identified email addresses, enabling organizations to understand their targets better and tailor their security strategies accordingly.
**Features:**
Parameter Identification: The platform defines ten key parameters for profiling, including age, gender, country, possible name, job title, social media profiles, interests, recent activities, affiliations, and contact numbers.
**Automated Profiling:** Utilizing advanced tools, the platform automates the profiling process to gather data on the identified parameters. This helps in building a comprehensive profile for each active email address.
**Manual Profiling:** Users can manually input or correct data using an Excel sheet if the automated process misses certain information. This ensures accuracy and completeness in the profiling process.

**Deliverables:**
A comprehensive profile for each active email address, complete with all the parameters listed above.

**4. AI-Driven Phishing Simulations**
**Goal:** To enhance organizational preparedness against phishing attacks by generating realistic phishing emails and simulating user responses using AI-driven personas.
**Features:**
**AI Model Training**: The platform collects a dataset of spam emails to train an AI model capable of identifying characteristics of spam emails and generating convincing phishing emails.
**Phishing Email Creation**: Using the trained model, the platform creates phishing emails that mimic the communication style of users within the target domain. These emails include phishing links or attachments to test the effectiveness of the simulation.
**Phishing Campaign Execution**: An AI bot sends the generated phishing emails to the identified active email addresses. The platform tracks and documents the success of these campaigns, measuring metrics such as email open rates and click rates on phishing links.
**Bot Communication and Validation**: The platform develops AI personas that mimic real-life users. These bots respond to phishing emails, simulating human behavior. The platform evaluates the success of phishing attempts based on the bots' responses. If a phishing attempt fails, the platform generates new email content and retries the attempt until successful.
