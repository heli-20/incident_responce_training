# incident_responce_training
A platform which trains bot to send phishing emails to another and the respective bot prevents the phishing emails from intrusion. I am developing a sophisticated AI-driven phishing bot designed to mimic legitimate emails and conduct a phishing campaign. The project will be divided into four parts: reconnaissance, profiling, phishing email generation, communication with bots and success of the campaign.
